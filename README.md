## Introduction

**Universal API Explorer** is an intelligent tool designed to simplify API interaction for **developers**, **learners**, and **non-technical users**. Whether you're testing endpoints, deciphering complex JSON responses, or learning API fundamentals, this tool bridges the gap between raw data and human understanding using AI.

### The Problem
- **Developers** waste time parsing sprawling API docs and debugging nested JSON structures.
- **Newcomers** struggle with jargon like "query params," "headers," and "authentication."
- **Everyone** faces repetitive tasks: manually crafting requests, guessing parameters, or pasting JSON into ChatGPT.

### The Solution
This app acts as your **AI-powered API assistant**:
1. **Automated Documentation Analysis**   
   - Paste an API documentation URL and a prompt for what you would like to do, and let AI extract relavant **endpoints**, **parameters**, **authentication methods**, and usage examples.
2. **Smart Parameter Guidance** 
   - Get AI-recommended parameters, headers, and keys based on the API's context (e.g., `?page=2` for pagination, `Authorization: Bearer` for tokens).
3. **Human-Readable Data + Raw Code** 
   - Receive API responses in **clean, formatted views** alongside **AI insights** (e.g., "This array contains 23 user objects with `id`, `email`, and `roles`").
   - Not only that, you still recieve the raw data that is retrived as welL!
4. **One-Click Exploration** 
   - Modify data safely: test `GET`/`POST`/`PUT`/`DELETE` without writing code or worrying about syntax errors and even view your API search history for reference!

### Why Use This Tool?
- **Developers**: Rapidly prototype, debug, or reverse-engineer APIs.  
- **Learners**: Understand APIs through AI explanations and real-time examples.  
- **Non-Technical Users**: Interact with APIs without codingâ€”perfect for product managers or data analysts.  

No more switching between Postman, docs, and ChatGPT. **Universal API Explorer** empowers you to work *smarter*, not harder.
